This project involves building a sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as either positive or negative. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and incorporates advanced RNN techniques such as Bidirectional GRU layers with dropout for regularization.
